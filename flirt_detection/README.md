# Flirt Detection Model

Tested out 15 different hyperparameter configurations for DistilBERT model. Most of them showed very bad generalization on the test set. 

The model i trained firstly turned out to be the best performing with 78% accuracy on test dataset. It is stored in 01_detection_training.ipynb.

Maybe I will try different configurations later.
