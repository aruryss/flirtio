### preprocessing done
i gathered everything in process_all.py file and as result got:
=== Processing Detection Data ===
Removed 4669 duplicates
Merged dataset size: 4368
Class distribution:
label
0.0    2397
1.0    1971
Name: count, dtype: int64
Balanced dataset size: 3942
Train size: 2758
Val size: 592
Test size: 592

all processed data is in: data\\processed -- and is already spread for detection
i guess we need additional data for generation but i not sure, if needed you can run the same preprocessing on it as well
